**Abstract:** In the emerging quantum internet, complex network topology could lead to efficient
quantum communication and enhanced robustness against failures. However, there
are some concerns about complexity in quantum communication networks, such as
potentially limited end-to-end transmission capacity. These challenges call for model
systems in which the feasibility and impact of complex network topology on quantum
communication protocols can be explored. Here, we present a theoretical model for
complex quantum communication networks on a lattice of spins, wherein entangled spin
clusters in interacting quantum spin systems serve as communication links between
appropriately selected regions of spins. Specifically, we show that ground state
Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger clusters of the two-dimensional random transverse Ising
model can be used as communication links between regions of spins, and we show
that the resulting quantum networks can have complexity comparable to that of the
classical internet. Our work provides an accessible generative model for further studies
towards determining the network characteristics of the emerging quantum internet.
