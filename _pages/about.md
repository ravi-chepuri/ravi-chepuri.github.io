Welcome! I am Ravi, a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Physics at the University of Maryland, College Park. My research interests are in complex systems — I seek to understand and model phenomena that arise from the interactions of many component parts. I am advised by [Professor Michelle Girvan](https://sites.google.com/umd.edu/networks/home).

Originally from Minneapolis, Minnesota, I received my bachelor's degree from Northwestern University in Physics, Math, and Integrated Science, where my undergraduate honors thesis was advised by [Professor István Kovács](https://sites.northwestern.edu/kovacslab/).

[Here is a link to my CV.](https://ravi-chepuri.github.io/cv/) Please contact me at rchepuri \[at\] umd \[dot\] edu.
